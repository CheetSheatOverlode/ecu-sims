# ecu-sims
A simulation of an ML controlled ECU with advanced throttle restriction for fuel efficiency

Contents:
1. Virtual dynamometer simulating 4 stroke engine
2. Training ML throttle control against fuel efficiency ratio as stimuli
3. Set up ficticious scenario of 2 hour uphill drive, decreasing air pressure and temperature
4. Test fuel efficiency of constant human throttle or ML throttle restrictions
